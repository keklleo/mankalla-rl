To anyone will read this against all odds: Hello, I appreciate you being here.

So [Mankala](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala) (aka Mancala or Kalaha) is a simple fun game with marbles that I used
to play with a friend of mine now and again. In doing so, we theorized a lot about optimal strategies and eventually
thought about using [Reinforcement Learning](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) to aid us in that
undertaking.

### Why is it spelled "Mankalla" in the code?

My friend misspelled it when we programmed the game for the first time, so I will stick with it until the end of time.

The state and action spaces of Mankala are both discrete, so Q-Learning will suffice as the first proof of concept.
